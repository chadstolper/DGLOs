pick a specific row or column to be the central node
For each matrix in the timeline:
If the row/column is in the matrix, create a node for it
	for each cell in the row or column
		If the row/coulmn it represents has a node
			draw an edge between it and this timesteps central node
			thicken/color node
		else if the row/column doesn't have a node
		 	draw a new node
			color/size based on data
			use force simulation to position the node
			draw an edge between this central node and the new node
			thicken/color edge based on data
