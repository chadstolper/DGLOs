#Create SVG elements (arbitrary elements) for each timestep to be displayed
#Slide each central node into its respective timestep
#Bring attached edges and copies of nodes along with it
#Resize and Recolor nodes based on some property
#For each timestep:
#Draw nodes in graph that haven't been yet displayed
#Reposition nodes based on force simulation
#Draw edges between nodes based on some property

For timesteps:
Remove exit nodeGlyphs
Remove exit edgeGlyphs
Restart simulation
Draw new nodeGlyphs
Draw new edgeGlyphs
Set nodeGlyphs {attr}
Set edgeGlyphs {attr}
