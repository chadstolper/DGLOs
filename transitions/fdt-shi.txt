Pick a central node
For each timestep:
Remove all nodes that are more than one node aeay from the central node
(If the central node isn't present in the timestep, remove it all)

Align central nodes 
If two or more nodes representing that same datum in different time steps exist:
Slide them so they are on top of one another
Bring the edges with them
