Pick a row or coulmn to be the central node
Create an edge from the central node to a new node for every cell in the row/column
For the rest of the timesteps:
If the row/column is in the timestep, create a node for it
	for all the cells in the row/column
		if there is a node already drawn representing that cells row/column
			create an edge between this central node and that node
			adjust its thickness/color based on data
		else
			create an edge to a new node from this central node
			color/size the node the node based on data
			color/size the edge based on data
