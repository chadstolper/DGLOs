#Remove all but one central node representing this timestep
#Remove Edges associated with other central nodes
#Draw remaining nodes in graph that were not in the ego graph
#Reposition nodes based on force simulation
#Draw edges associated with those nodes
#Recolor nodes, fatten edge based on some property
#add noise nodes
#draw regions (fade? expand? restart sim? george lucas?)
#reduce node radius
#change color of edges
#change color of nodes to regions(shouldnt be needed)
